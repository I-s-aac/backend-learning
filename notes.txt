http can't have state (the server doesn't remember which client did what, aka it just doesn't remember stuff)
status codes
1xx informational response
2xx success
3xx redirection
4xx client error
5xx server error
difference between https and http: https requires security and stuff (s for security or something)

let req = http.request(options, (response) => {
  // do stuff
})

you can use the same url for stuff but do different things based on the http method
